\section{Introduction}

\todo{ Write briefly about the project, the course it belongs to and the goal}
\break
This is the introduction section. Here we write something appealing for you to continue on. If you finish this, you will be baked a cake.
\break
\break
As part of the course TDT4260 Computer Architecture, students in groups of 3 or 4 were to implement and test a prefetcher. This report describes the implementation with test results done by group 11. The report will describe the implemented prefetcher, how it was implemented, the framework and the test results.

\section{Related Work}
\todo{ Not sure, mention related work?}
\break
Here we mention related work. Do you want cake for your relatives?
\section{Prefetcher Description}
\todo{ Describe how the final prefetcher works. I suggest adding a figure. Maybe briefly mention other attempteps while if we have space?}
\break

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/DCTable}
  \caption{Delta Correlation Table}
  \label{fig:DCTable}
\end{figure}

\break
Figure \ref{fig:DCTable} shows the table.
\break
\todo{ Describe the pretecher, namely the different parts of the table in the figure. Have added places to write.}

Here we describe the cake...uh, I mean the pretecher. Hey, Vance! Can you prefetch that cake?
\section{Methodology}
\todo{ Mention the framework. Explain PFJudge. Maybe or maybe not mention C++?}
\break

Here we describe how we did it.

WARNING: Recipee too long. Insert cake recipe here!
\section{Results}
\todo{ Describe results from both local and PFJudge.}
\break

EXPLOSION!
\section{Discussion}
\todo{ Not exaclty sure, just say it works better? Compare with other prefetcher IF we chose to describe them. }
\break


You killed GLaDOS.
You monster.
\section{Conclusion}
\todo{ Mention what could have been done better or different? Future ideas? }
\break

The cake is a lie!
